# Hacking The Fender

The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. 
In this task, my mission is threefold. I must acquire access to The Fenderâ€˜s systems, I must update the fender's "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing I need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.

Knowledge of working with Python files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data and with CSV files and other text files is used.
